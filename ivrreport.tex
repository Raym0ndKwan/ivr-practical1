\chapter{Methods}                % Print a "chapter" heading

Which methods were used? 
 
\section{Method 1}                  % Print a "section" heading
Give a functional outline of how this method was implemented and the structure of the code. Explain how each part of it is meant to work. Where suitable, justify your
decisions, e.g. why you used one method rather than another, what you tried
that didn't work as expected

\section{Method 2}                  % Print a "section" heading
etc.

\chapter{Results}                % Print a "chapter" heading
You should provide some actual data, from repeated trials (with the
camera or robots in different positions) on how well your algorithm performs,
as described previously. Show an example of your results for each stage of
the detection. Well documented failure will get more marks than unsupported
claims of success (well-documented success would be even better!).


\chapter{Discussion}                % Print a "chapter" heading
Assess the success of your program with regard to the reported results, and explain any limitations, problems or improvements you would make.
